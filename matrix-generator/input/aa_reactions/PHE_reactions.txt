16*ATP + 8*Fdred + N2 →  2*NH3 + 1*H2
2-Oxoglutarate + 1*NH3 + 1*NADH → L-Glutamate + H2O
1*ATP + 1*Pyruvate → Phosphoenolpyruvate 
Phosphoenolpyruvate + H2O → 2-Phospho-D-Glycerate
2-Phospho-D-Glycerate → 3-Phospho-D-Glycerate
1*ATP + 3-Phospho-D-Glycerate → 3-Phospho-D-Glyceroyl-phosphate 
3-Phospho-D-Glyceroyl-phosphate + 1*NADH → D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate → Glycerone-phosphate 
Glycerone-phosphate + D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate → beta-D-Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
beta-D-Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate + H2O → beta-D-Fructose-6-phosphate 
beta-D-Fructose-6-phosphate + D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate → D-Erythrose-4-phosphate + D-Xylulose-5-phosphate
Phosphoenolpyruvate + D-Erythrose-4-phosphate + H2O → 2-Dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptonate-7-phosphate 
2-Dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptonate-7-phosphate → 3-Dehydroquinate 
3-Dehydroquinate → 3-Dehydroshikimate + H2O
3-Dehydroshikimate + 1*NADH → Shikimate
1*ATP + Shikimate → Shikimate-3-phosphate
Phosphoenolpyruvate + Shikimate-3-phosphate → 5-O-(1-Carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate
5-O-(1-Carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate → Chorismate
Chorismate → Prephenate 
Prephenate → Phenylpyruvate + H2O + CO2
Phenylpyruvate + L-Glutamate → L-Phenylalanine + 2-Oxoglutarate
D-Xylulose-5-phosphate → D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + Acetate
Acetate + 1*ATP → 1*Acetyl-CoA
